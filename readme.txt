Share password protected posts via secret URLs

== Description ==

Share a link to anonymous users to view private and password protected posts (or any other public post type).

This plugin generates secret URLs (similar to Google Docs and other cloud services) for posts so you can share them with not-logged in users without having to share an extra password with them.

== Installation ==

Note: There will be NO settings page.

For an automatic installation through WordPress:

1. Go to the 'Add New' plugins screen in your WordPress admin area
1. Search for 'Public Post Preview'
1. Click 'Install Now' and activate the plugin


For a manual installation via FTP:

1. Upload the `public-post-preview` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in your WordPress admin area


To upload the plugin through WordPress, instead of FTP:

1. Upload the downloaded zip file on the 'Add New' plugins screen (see the 'Upload' tab) in your WordPress admin area and activate.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.
