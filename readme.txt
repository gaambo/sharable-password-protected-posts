Share password protected posts via secret URLs

== Description ==

Share a link to anonymous users to view private and password protected posts (or any other public post type).

This plugin generates secret URLs (similar to Google Docs and other cloud services) for posts so you can share them with not-logged in users without having to share an extra password with them.
