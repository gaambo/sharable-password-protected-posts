# Private Post Share

**Previous Name: Sharable Password Protected Posts**

WordPress plugin to share a link to anonymous users to view private and password protected posts (or any other public
post type).

This plugin generates secret URLs (similar to Google Docs and other cloud services) for posts so you can share them with
not-logged-in users without having to share an extra password with them.
